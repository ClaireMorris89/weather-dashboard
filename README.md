# weather-dashboard

## Description 

This Weather Dashboard provides a platform for users to find the current weather for a specific city, as well as a 5-day forecast. The forecast provides the name of the city, the day of the week, the temperature with an icon, wind speed, and humidity. 

## Usage

This website can be used to search the weather of any US city. After pulling up the weather, the searched city will add to the search-history list, where users can then re-call at a later time.
